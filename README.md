This repo is a track of my practice and knowledge of data structures and algo using Python as the main language. Every day, I will be solving new problems from Leetcode/Neetcode, and learn something new in the process.

This is an effort to improve my problem solving ability and apply it to real-world problems (or try atleast ;) )
